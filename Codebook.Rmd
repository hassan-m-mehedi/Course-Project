run_analysis.R file performs the following functions:

1. downloads the dataset
2. unzips the datasets into UCI HAR DATASET folder
3. reads the text files and assigns them into following variables:
  
  features: features.txt is read into this variable
  
  activities: activity_labels.txt is read into this variable
  
  subject_test: Subject_test.txt is read into this variable
  
  subject_train: Subject_train is read into this variable
  
  x_test: X_test.txt is read into this variable
  
  x_train: X_train.txt is read into this variable
  
  y_test: y_test.txt is read into this variable
  
  y_train: y_train is read into this variable
  
4. merges the datasets into one, "merged_data" variabe
5. extracts mean and standard deviation for each measurement and assigns them into extracted_data variable.
6. names the activities in datasets using descriptive activity names
7. creates a second and indepent dataset named "independent data.txt"
